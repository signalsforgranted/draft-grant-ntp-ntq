1.  Introduction

   Network Time Security (NTS) [RFC8915] defines the NTS Key
   Establishment (NTS-KE) protocol, which uses TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] over
   TCP to secure the distribution of NTP server information and cookies.

   There are several key reasons to consider the use of QUIC for NTS Key
   Establishment services; QUIC like NTP is based on UDP, which means
   that networks or network segments operating time services can
   restrict

   Not all of QUIC's capabilities are applicable to providing NTS-KE,
   however these should not pose any notable concerns for implementers
   who would most likely be using existing QUIC implementations.

   *TODO*: Define what QUIC features aren't of use

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  QUIC Connectivity

3.1.  Connection Initiation

   By default, servers should listen and accept QUIC connections on UDP
   port 4460, unless there is a mutual agreement to use another port.

   NTS key establishment connections are established as described in the
   QUIC transport specification [RFC9000].  During connection
   establishment support is indicated with the client offering, and the
   server accepting the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
   token "ntske/1" as per [RFC8915].

   *TODO*: Confirm ALPN reuse

   All key establishment requests and responses MUST take place through
   the use of streams; other types MUST NOT be used.  The client must
   initiate an initial bidirectional stream, starting from 0.  After
   each complete key establishment request has been sent, it MUST send a
   STREAM FIN message to indicate no further data be sent.

   All payloads sent within the stream must be in accordance with
   Section 4, [RFC8915].

3.2.  Connection Shutdown

   *TODO*: Discuss connection cessation, including GOAWAY behaviour

3.3.  Error Handling

   *TODO*: Error codes should be specified, however it's worth noting
   that in NTS the code point 0x0 is an error, whereas in QUIC derived
   protocols 0x0 usually signals that there is no error.

4.  Security Considerations

   General security considerations for time protocols are discussed in
   RFC 7384 [RFC7384].

   *TODO*: Security considerations

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry

   IANA is requested to allocate the following entry in the Service Name
   and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry [RFC6335]:

   Service Name:  ntske

   Transport Protocol:  udp
